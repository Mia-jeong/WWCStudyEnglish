### 2. Write an essay

after I watched this show, I decided to try the plank for 30 days, which is the exercise like you're standing with feet, shoulder's width apart, and bending forward at a waist and holding your hands on the floor. 

I hava some backache, so the chiropractor said to me that I should make my core very strong. and it turns out that the plank is one of the most effective exercises to do it. 

as the speaker said it to us, the next 30 days are going to pass whether we like it or not, so why don't I spend at least 1 minute working out for my back. the challenge might be a little hard in the first place, but If I get through it, I'm sure I'm getting more energitic for my life
