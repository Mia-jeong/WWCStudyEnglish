#Talk nerdy to me
Reducing communications cost is important when you work with people who has rarely background knowledge with development. 
Developers need to less use their jargon when talk to colleagues like designers or project managers. 
As mentioned at Ted video, Jargon is totally barrier to both side and it is easy to make an impression that you are inconsiderate person. 
In my opinion, the better way is if you should use jargon then adding the meaning right after the jargon. 
For example, if you need to use the word 'Lifecycle' of Android OS, you can say 'It depends on lifecycle which is specific flow on Android system allow to handle user interaction.
