## Talk nerdy to me

I was little awkward when I start the team project.
A month ago, when I told other team members about my position. they understanded “I’m a developer.”

But after that, when I explained
“I’ll develop backend for one month.”
And they started to get confused.

Because two of them are not developers. and they had no ideas with my jargons.
Of course I usually cares about it, but it’s difficult to gauge what they know.

So after that, I started to practice to explain with easy words as possible as I can.
Sometimes it's almost impossible to talk without any jargons, but at least we can try.
